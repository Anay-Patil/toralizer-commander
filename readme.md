## **Usage**

### **Run the Proxy Client**

To use **TorCommander**, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
./torcommander <host> <port>
```

- **<host>**: The destination host you want to connect to through the SOCKS4 proxy.
- **<port>**: The destination port on the host.

## **Configuration**

### **Proxy Configuration**

By default, **TorCommander** connects to the SOCKS4 proxy at `127.0.0.1` (localhost) on port `9050`. If you want to change the proxy address or port, you can modify the `PROXY` and `PROXYPORT` values in the `toralizer.h` header file:

```c
#define PROXY "127.0.0.1"  // Set the proxy server IP address
#define PROXYPORT 9050     // Set the proxy server port
```
